# Atlas-Labs-HR-analytics
Preparing, modeling, and creating a dashboard for Atlas Labs Project
### This project was done on a virtual company dataset. The dataset represents a small warehouse with a fact table of the performance of employees in many dimensions.
My task was to import the data, clean it, create the ER diagram model, and analyze the attrition rate of employees. 
- Attrition: The customer turnover or churn.

### Here are some of the major key insights that I found from analyzing the data set.

2. The highest department in terms of attrition rate is technology.
3. The software engineer job role is the most likely job of attrition followed by data scientists
